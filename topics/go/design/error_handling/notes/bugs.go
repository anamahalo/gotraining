// Bugs are NOT flaws in code, but rather
// a FAILURE TO PREDICT what that code would do
// .: We shouldn't focus on the broken code,
//    but on improving our predictions.

// So how do we improve our predictions?
//  Tests
//      Writing them, and actual usability
//  Complexity
//      K.I.S.S., otherwise taxes our mental models as humans
//  Playing computer
//      Don't predict; execute
//      (i.e.: let the compiler tell you, or execute rather than guessing)
//  "Readability" - actually PREDICTABILITY
//      Prediction is more likely when a piece of code LOOKS like what it does
//      Best measure: how often would a programmer NEW TO THIS CODE make CORRECT
//          predictions about how it behaves?

// readability isn't just about reducing overhead but also working to mitigate
//  errors and debunking assumptions
