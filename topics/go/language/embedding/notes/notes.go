// Embedding
// Final piece of sharing and reusing state and behavior between types
// Thru use of inner type promotion, an inner type's fields
// and methods can be directly accessed by references
// of the outer type

//  Embedding types allows us to share state or behavior
//  between types
//  Inner type loses its identity
//  Not inheritance
//  Through promotion, inner type fields and methods
//  can be accessed through the outer type.
//  The outer type can override the inner type's behavior
